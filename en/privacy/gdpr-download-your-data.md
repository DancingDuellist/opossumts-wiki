Hey Guys üëã

As you might now, the GDPR went into force in 2018. A lot of things changed for online service providers like we are. Among other things, the GDPR stipulates that users (that is, you) must have access to the data stored by the provider (in this case, that is us) at all times. Therefore I would like to explain to you here how you can see & download your data.

### Boards

In order to download the data stored about you by our boards system, you just have to log in and click "Personal data export" in your user menu. Everything else should be self-explanatory.

### TeamSpeak

For security reasons, you can only download your TeamSpeak data when you are connected to the server. This is the easiest way for us to determine that you are really you. Once you're connected, all you have to do is go to the [privacy page](https://www.opossumts.net/dsgvo-export/) and follow the instructions there. If other people use the same network connection, you have to confirm your identity.

If you have any questions or feedback, just get in touch with a team member! :)
